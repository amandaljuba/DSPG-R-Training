##Intro to Markdown 

Markdown allows you to **bold**, _italicize_, and more!

Make a list with asterisks like:
\*bold with double asterisks 
\*italics with underscores
\*code-type with back ticks

You can also use hyphens instead of asterisks

For numbered lists:
\. bold...
\. italics
\. code...

Hyperlinks are [Hyperlinked Text](https://mylink.org) 

```{r load_data}
library(gapminder)
gap <- gapminder 
```


```{r make-plot}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, data=gap)
```

```{r}
temp <- c(1,2,3)
```
